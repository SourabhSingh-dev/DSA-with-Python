## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topics Covered:**  
  - Revision of **Recursion** notes and problems  
  - Revision of all **Sorting Techniques**: Selection, Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick

* 💻 **Problems Solved:**
  - ✅ Started **Arrays** module:
    - `find_largest_element.py`
    - `find_smallest_element.py`
    - `second_largest_element.py`
    - `remove_duplicates_sorted_array.py` (struggled, later recognized **Two Pointers** pattern)

* 📘 **Resources Used:**  
  - Code & Debug Playlist  
  - GFG + VS Code + Notion for notes and implementation

## 🔄 Next Up:
* Continue solving remaining **Arrays** questions  
* Focus more on **Pattern Recognition** for Arrays and 2-Pointer techniques  
---

## 📝 Reflection:
* Reaffirmed the importance of pattern-driven thinking in problem-solving.
* Will explore the **DSA 64 Patterns Sheet** to build stronger intuition over time.
