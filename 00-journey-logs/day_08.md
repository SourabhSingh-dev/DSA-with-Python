# 🗓️ Day 08 – 11/07/2025

### 📍 Status: ⚠️ Partially Completed (Fatigue Acknowledged)

---

## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topic:** Arrays (Continued)
  - ✅ Revised all previous array-based concepts
  - ✅ Watched video & attempted:
    - `Rotate Array by One Place`
    - `Rotate Array by K Places` (Recursion attempt - TLE)
  - ✅ Successfully solved:
    - `Move Zeroes to End` using Two Pointer Technique
  - ✅ Identified familiar patterns → Applied **Remove Duplicates** logic

* 📘 **Resources:**
  - Code & Debug DSA Playlist
  - Peer revision, inner recall, and self-nudges

---

## 💻 Problems Attempted:
- `rotate_array_by_one.py` ✅
- `rotate_array_by_k.py` ⚠️ (Recursion attempt – TLE)
- `move_zeroes.py` ✅ (Two-pointer optimized)
- `linear_search.py` ✅ (Basic practice)
- `merge_sorted_arrays.py` ❌ (Mental fatigue – deferred)

---

## 🧠 Reflections:
* Feeling the **power of daily revision** – instantly recalled patterns today
* Solved a known pattern (move zeroes) *fully on my own* – huge win 🎯

---

## 🔄 Next Up:
* Retry `Merge Two Sorted Arrays` (Fresh mind, fresh eyes)
* Continue solving 2–3 array problems with a focus on patterns
* Keep pattern-based tracking in Notion updated
