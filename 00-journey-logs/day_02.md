# 🗓️ Day 02 – 14/06/2025

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

---

## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topic Studied:** Number-based problems (digit extraction, palindrome, armstrong number, factor count)

* 📘 **Resources:** Code & Debug DSA Playlist + GFG Problem Sheet

* 💻 **Problems Solved:**

  * `count_digits.py`
  * `count_even_digits.py`
  * `print_digits.py`
  * `reverse_integer.py`
  * `reverse_integer_betterway.py`
  * `palindrome.py`
  * `armstrong_number.py`
  * `factors_of_a_number.py` (Initial version caused TLE)

* 🧠 **Concepts I understood:**

  * Handle negatives carefully in Armstrong & Palindrome problems
  * How to optimize factor counting using square root logic to avoid TLE
  * Rewriting long solutions after reviewing best submissions

* 📁 **GitHub Updates:**

  * Added updated solutions in `01-numbers/` folder
  * Refactored `armstrong_number.py` into a shorter version using list comprehension

---

## 🔄 Next Up:

* Continue with GCD, LCM, and remaining number-based questions
* Prepare for DS practice after revising inbuilt Python data structures

---

## 📝 Notes & Reflections:

* TLE on factor-counting problem helped me realize the cost of linear loops on large input
* Reviewing submission tabs gives great insights into cleaner and faster solutions
