# 🗓️ Day 03 – [16/06/2025]
### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

---

## ✅ What I did today:

- 📌 **Topic Studied:** Hashing – List vs Dictionary
- 📘 **Resources:** Code & Debug Playlist – Hashing Section

### 💻 Problems Solved:
From `02-Hashing/`:
- `betterway/`
- `frequency_dictionary.py`
- `prime_check.py`
- `character-hashing.py` ✅
- `numbers-hashing.py` ✅
- `frequency_in_a_limited_array.py` ✅
- `frequency_of_x.py` ✅

✅ Implemented both **list-based and dictionary-based hashing** where relevant

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced:
- When to use `list` vs `dict` for hashing
- Hashing character frequency using `ord()` and dictionary `.get()`
- Constraint handling for lowercase-only and integer-limited inputs

---

## 📁 Folder Structure:
- Maintained clean separation in `02-Hashing/`
- Continued saving optimized versions in `betterway/` (if any found)

---

## 🔄 Next Up:
- Start **recursion problems** from GFG x Leetcode Sheet
- Watch only recursion theory videos (skip walkthroughs)
