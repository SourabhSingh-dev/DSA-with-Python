# 🗓️ Day 11 – 09/08/2025

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topic:** Arrays – Two Pointer & Hashmap Technique
  - ✅ Practiced `Two Sum` from LeetCode
  - ✅ Implemented initial pointer-reset version (O(n²)) and understood why it’s nested loops in disguise
  - ✅ Learned and implemented optimal **Hashmap** solution (O(n) time, O(n) space)
  - ✅ Traced step-by-step execution to understand the **complement** concept
  - ✅ Compared brute-force vs optimal in code and complexity
  - ✅ Maintained Notion notes with explanation, dry runs, and complexity proofs

* 📘 **Resources:**
  - LeetCode Problem: Two Sum
  - Self-debugging + iterative refinement through explanation

## 💻 Problem Solved:
- `two_sum.py` ✅ (Brute-force with two pointers & Optimal Hashmap approach)

---

## 🧠 Reflections:
* Realized that not every “two pointer” problem in a sheet is the **true O(n) two-pointer** — sometimes it’s grouped by category, not optimal method
* Learned to spot hidden O(n²) behavior even in single `while` loops if variables reset
* Understood why Hashmaps are a natural fit for fast lookups in pairing problems
* Built intuition for **pattern recognition** — brute force first, then optimize

---

## 🔄 Next Up:
* Continue with more **Two Pointer** problems from the sheet
* Move towards 3Sum and 4Sum to apply real two-pointer after sorting
* Keep tracking O(n²) vs O(n) approaches for the same problem type
