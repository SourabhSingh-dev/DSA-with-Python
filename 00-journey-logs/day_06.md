# 🗓️ Day 06 – [06/07/2025]

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

---

## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topic Studied:** Sorting Algorithms  
* 📘 **Resources:** Code & Debug DSA Playlist + GFG Problems  
* 💻 **Coding Language:** Python

---

## 🔢 Sorting Covered:

- ✅ Selection Sort (asc + desc)
- ✅ Bubble Sort (standard, best-case, variant)
- ✅ Insertion Sort (standard)
- ✅ Merge Sort 
- ✅ Quick Sort (video + implementation)

---

## 💻 GFG Problems Solved:

- ✅ Selection Sort GFG
- ✅ Bubble Sort GFG
- ✅ Insertion Sort GFG
- ✅ Merge Sort GFG (full debug with slicing & subarrays)
- ⏳ Quick Sort GFG – Attempted, solution logic understood (to retry tomorrow)

---

## 📁 GitHub Updates:

* ✅ Folder: `04-sorting` created
* ✅ Added:
  - `selection_sort.py`, `selection_sort_descending.py`
  - `bubble_sort.py`, `bubble_sort_best_case.py`, `bubble_sort_other_way.py`
  - `insertion_sort.py`
  - `merge_sort.py`, `gfg_merge_sort_problem.py`
  - `quick_sort.py`
* ✅ Markdown log pushed as `day_06.md`

---

## 🔁 Revision Insights:

* Added pattern notes for Bubble Sort & Insertion Sort  
* Identified confusion between full-array merge sort vs subarray segment merge (clarified)

---

## 📝 Notes & Reflections:

* Merge sort GFG implementation challenged me — slicing & subarray range was key  
* Quick sort conceptually solid, GFG edge cases pending  
* Still shocked how recursion subtly powers these divide & conquer sorts  
---

## 🔄 Next Up:

* ✅ Solve Quick Sort GFG edge cases (morning revision)
* ✅ Recursive Bubble Sort
* ✅ Begin revision scheduling
