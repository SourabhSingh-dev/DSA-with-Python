# 🗓️ Day 09 – 07/08/2025

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

---

## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topic:** Arrays – Two Pointer Technique
  - ✅ Solved `Merge Two Sorted Arrays` from LearnYard DSA Sheet
  - ✅ Understood and implemented the **reverse two-pointer approach**
  - ✅ Covered edge cases and dry-run logic manually
  - ✅ Maintained clean Notion notes with explanation + code

* 📘 **Resources:**
  - LearnYard DSA Sheet (Two Pointer Section)
  - Self-debugging + guided hints for edge case handling

---

## 💻 Problem Solved:
- `merge_two_sorted_arrays.py` ✅ (Reverse Two Pointer, In-Place Merge)

---

## 🧠 Reflections:
* Deeply understood the need for **reverse traversal** to avoid overwriting
* Identified and fixed edge case: when `nums1` has no initial elements
* Solved the full problem with only a minor nudge — true pattern internalization 🧩

---

## 🔄 Next Up:
* Continue with next problems from the **Two Pointer section**
* Solve 2–3 more problems applying this strategy
* Update Notion DSA pattern map for tracking learned techniques
