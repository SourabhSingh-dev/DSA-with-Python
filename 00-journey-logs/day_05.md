# 🗓️ Day 05 – [04/07/2025]

### 📍 Status: ✅ Completed

---

## ✅ What I did today:

* 📌 **Topic Studied:** Recursion (Wrap-up)
* 📘 **Resources:** Code & Debug DSA Playlist (Recursion – Parts 3 to Final)

* 💻 **Problems Solved:**
  - `1_to_n_without_loop.py` – Head recursion
  - `N_to_1.py` – Tail recursion
  - `print_n_times.py` – Parameter-based recursion
  - `palindrome_string_with_loop.py` – Iterative (two pointers)
  - `palindrome_without_loop.py` – Recursive string check
  - `factorial_of_a_number.py` – Classic recursion
  - `factorial_less_than_or_equal_to_n.py` – Optimized iterative + recursive
  - `reverse_array_without_loop.py` – Recursive two-pointer
  - `series_sum.py` – Accumulative recursion
  - ✅ Watched Fibonacci solution + noted in Notion

---

## 🔁 Revision Highlights:

* Understood:
  - Base vs Recursive Case
  - Head vs Tail Recursion
  - Recursion ≈ loop logic split into stack calls

* 🧠 Patterns Identified:
  - Pattern #01: Two Pointers
  - Pattern #02: Tail Recursion with Accumulation
  - Pattern #03: Cumulative Multiplication Until Threshold
  - Pattern #04: Recursive Backward Building

---

## 📁 GitHub Updates:

* ✅ Added:
  - `03-recursion/betterway/*.py` – Clean, optimized implementations
  - Refactored structure to separate raw and improved solutions

---

## 🔄 Next Up:

* 🔁 Start Sorting
* 🧠 Finalize pattern notes in Notion
* 🏷️ Tag upcoming recursion problems by pattern (Boolean Return, Subset Builder, etc.)

---

## 📝 Notes & Reflections:

* ❌ Missed GitHub push before midnight — streak broke  
  ✅ But still completed work, committed, and stayed disciplined  
* 🧠 Realized: Recursion becomes easy when visualized like loop + call stack  
* 🧾 All recursion notes and examples prepared for DSA Pattern log
